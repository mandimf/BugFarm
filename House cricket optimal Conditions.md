**Cricket density**
 
There is a limit to the number of crickets that can be held in a given area without incurring crowding. A higher mortality exists when the crickets have to limited amount of space. Patton (1978) concludes that each cricket should have 2,5 cm2 of crawl space to have a minimized mortality rate and a maximized use of space.
 



**Temperature**

Minimum: 25°C (Below 25°C, the development is very prolonged and survival low) (Busvine, 1955)

Optimal: 26°C-32°C (Optimal 30°C) (Clifford, 1990)

Maximum: above 35°C (Temperature above 35°C causes near 100% mortality rate) (Clifford, 1990)



**Humidity**

adults 

-Optimal: Less than 50%
 

**Light**

Natural day-night ratio
Using a light as heating source is not optimal. It was found that when using a light for heating, and therefor 24 hours light, that very few of the eggs will hatch.
