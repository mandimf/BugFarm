### Aim

To create a cheap, safe and simple heat source for insect farming using readily available materials.

### Problem statement

Many insect species thrive at temperatures above what is usually comfortable in the home, or available outdoors for much of the year. Crickets, for instance, thrive at around 86 degrees fahrenheit.

Heat mats and lamps, designed for use with glass terraria, can be dangerous - they carry a risk of fire due to their high surface temperature and the possibility of direct contact.

### Concept

Indirect heat is safest for home use. Using a cheap aquarium immersion heater and a robust water container, it is possible to create an indirect heat source ideal for heating a small space used as an insect habitat.

### Basic components

* Plastic bucket, e.g. http://www.homedepot.com/p/Homer-Bucket-5-Gal-Orange-Bucket-05GLHD2/100087613
* Tight-fitting lid, e.g. http://www.homedepot.com/p/Argee-Homer-5-gal-Bucket-Lid-RG5503/100037401
* Aquarium immersion heater with integral thermostat, e.g. http://www.amazon.com/ViaAqua-50-Watt-Submersible-Built-In-Thermostat/dp/B005440HLO/ref=sr_1_1?s=pet-supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1393521641&sr=1-1
* Safety surge protector/circuit breaker
* Thermometer
* Bleach

### Instructions

Heating will work best in an enclosed space - a cupboard/closet, or a hydroponic grow tent.

Fill the plastic bucket with water. Add a small amount of bleach to prevent growth of bacteria and algae.

Following directions supplied with the unit, place the immersion heater in the water - usually so that it is  fully covered and attached by suction cup to the side.

Cut holes in the bucket lid and thread the power cables through.

Seat the bucket lid.

Plug in the heater and set the thermostat to slightly higher than your desired environment temperature.

Leave for several hours for the temperature to settle.

Use the thermometer to determine whether the temperature of the space has reached the desired level. If not, adjust the thermostat accordingly.
