### Aim

To create a cheap, safe and simple heat source for insect farming using readily available materials.

### Problem statement

Many insect species thrive at temperatures above what is usually comfortable in the home, or available outdoors for much of the year. Crickets, for instance, thrive at around 86 degrees fahrenheit.

Heat mats and lamps, designed for use with glass terraria, can be dangerous - they carry a risk of fire due to their high surface temperature and the possibility of direct contact.

### Concept

Indirect heat is safest for home use. Using a cheap aquarium immersion heater and a robust water container, it is possible to create an indirect heat source ideal for heating a small space used as an insect habitat.

#### Basic components

* Plastic bucket, e.g.:

* Tight-fitting lid, e.g.:
    * http://www.homedepot.com/p/Argee-Homer-5-gal-Bucket-Lid-RG5503/100037401
* Aquarium immersion heater with integral thermostat, e.g.:
    * http://www.amazon.com/ViaAqua-50-Watt-Submersible-Built-In-Thermostat/dp/B005440HLO/ref=sr_1_1?s=pet-supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1393521641&sr=1-1
* Safety surge protector/circuit breaker
* Thermometer
* Bleach

#### Instructions

Heating will work best in an enclosed space - a cupboard/closet, or a hydroponic grow tent.

Fill the plastic bucket with water. Add a small amount of bleach to prevent growth of bacteria and algae.

Following directions supplied with the unit, place the immersion heater in the water - usually so that it is  fully covered and attached by suction cup to the side.

Cut holes in the bucket lid and thread the power cables through.

Seat the bucket lid.

Plug in the heater, via the surge protector, and set the thermostat to slightly higher than your desired environment temperature.

Leave for several hours for the temperature to settle.

Use the thermometer to determine whether the temperature of the space has reached the desired level. If not, adjust the thermostat accordingly. Recalibrate periodically as ambient temperature changes throughout the year.

**Check water levels regularly** and refill as required.

#### Improving temperature response

If only the temperature of the water is regulated, the habitat temperature may fluctuate unacceptably based on ambient conditions, and may require recalibration. Ideally, the level of heating should be determined by the temperature of the space being heated rather than the direct temperature of the water in the bucket.

It is possible to use a separate temperature controller for this purpose. This process involves mains wiring and should only be done by someone with the required competence.

##### Additional equipment
* Switching temperature controller, e.g.:
    * http://www.amazon.com/Elitech-All-Purpose-Temperature-Controller-Thermostat/dp/B008KVCPH2

##### Instructions

Set the heater's built-in thermostat to maximum, and connect it to mains power through the temperature controller. Place the temperature controller's thermocouple within the climate controlled area and set to the target temperature.

##### Advanced

While an aquarium heater provides many benefits in safety, simplicity and often an integral thermostat, a separate temperature controller can be used with a simpler and cheaper direct AC heating element. We don't recommend this unless you are qualified to work with mains electricity.

#### Introducing a pump

Often, the space requiring heating doesn't have room for both insect habitats and the large bucket/heater assembly. In this case, tubing and a pump can be used to move heat from the bucket into the climate controlled space.

A small pump will circulate heated water from the bucket around a closed loop of flexible tubing that makes its way throughout the climate controlled space before returning to the bucket. The bucket will be insulated so that heat is not lost from anywhere except the tubing.

##### Additional equipment

Much of the required equipment can be obtained from a hydroponics supplier. The links here are for illustrative purposes only; we have no experience with this supplier.

* Flexible plastic tubing, such as 1/2" or 1/4" black poly tubing, or airline tubing e.g.:

    * http://www.drsfostersmith.com/fish-supplies/aquarium-air-pump/aquarium-airline-tubing-valves/ps/c/3578/3669/8046
* Connectors and fittings, e.g.:
    * http://www.htgsupply.com/Product-one-half-inch-Double-Barbed-Connector
    * http://www.htgsupply.com/Product-half-inch-Barbed-Elbow
* Small pump, capacity dependent on length and layout of tubing, e.g.:
    * http://www.htgsupply.com/Product-160-GPH-Submersible-Pump-for-Hydroponics-Systems
* Insulation to wrap the bucket; alternately a pre-insulated camping-style "cooler" could be used, e.g.:
    * http://www.walmart.com/cp/Coolers/5164

##### Instructions

The tubing should be laid in a circuit around the area to be heated, taking care not to exceed the vertical feet for which the pump is rated. Fittings should be used to avoid kinks in the tubing that would otherwise constrain flow.

The pump should be submerged in the bucket, connected to short lengths of tubing that terminate in connectors. These connectors should then be joined to the circuit of tubing. This will allow for easy disconnection and drainage of the system if required. Holes should be cut in the lid to permit the pump's tubing and wiring to pass.

The entire bucket should be wrapped with an insulating material, for example bubble wrap or fiberglass or Reflectix [http://www.homedepot.com/b/Reflectix/N-5yc1vZ19n](http://www.homedepot.com/b/Reflectix/N-5yc1vZ19n) . Alternately, an insulated camping-style cooler can be used in place of the bucket (although it may be difficult to drill holes for tubing and wiring).

The pump should be connected to the surge protector and powered on continuously, keeping water flowing throughout the system.


##### Example Implementation

An excellent example of implementing this system is well documented on the Open Bug Farm forum here [http://www.openbugfarm.com/forum.html#/discussion/91/my-attempt-guide-at-radiant-heating-with-an-immersion-heater-and-pump](http://www.openbugfarm.com/forum.html#/discussion/91/my-attempt-guide-at-radiant-heating-with-an-immersion-heater-and-pump)
