### Types of pests
#### Ants
To avoid ants inside bins use small trays containing water on the foot of bins.
To get rid of ants already inside the colony, place a small plastic foil with a honey drop to attract ants, let ants come to the foil and then collect the foil with the ants. Repeat the process until all ants vanish.![](https://31.media.tumblr.com/dc706819cb21eab4dc5682a6216aaf29/tumblr_n0h0rqTAjX1rayucwo1_500.png)
