# Open Source tools and Resources

## Here is a list for open sources hardware, software and other resources available that may be useful to members of the Open Bug Farm community.

### Public Lab - Open Source Science

Public Lab from their website ([www.publiclab.org](www.publiclab.org)) is:

>a community -- supported by a 501(c)3 non-profit -- which develops and applies open-source tools to 
>environmental exploration and investigation. By democratizing inexpensive and accessible Do-It-Yourself
>techniques, Public Lab creates a collaborative network of practitioners who actively re-imagine the human
>relationship with the environment.

And they have a few projects with potential for application to our efforts advancing insect farming practice:

### Public Lab Tools

Of particular interest:
[Spectrometer](http://publiclab.org/wiki/spectrometer) - identify chemicals

[Near Infrared Camera](http://publiclab.org/wiki/near-infrared-camera) - typically used to assess plant health, who knows what it might tell us about insects, or potentially spot mold/fungal growth, etc..

[Thermal Camera](http://publiclab.org/wiki/thermal-camera) - useful to optimize environmental management in a facility, individual habitats, possibly to track insect concentrations

[Water Quality Sensor](http://publiclab.org/wiki/water-quality-sensor) - especially in developing or off-the-grid contexts

### Smartphone microscope kit

This open project, available on Instructables here [http://www.instructables.com/id/10-Smartphone-to-digital-microscope-conversion/](http://www.instructables.com/id/10-Smartphone-to-digital-microscope-conversion/) has plans for an easy to build (~$10) platform that converts your smartphone into a microscope
(Tiny Farms team has built one of these and it's awesome!)
