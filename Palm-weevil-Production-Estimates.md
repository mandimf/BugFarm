###How big does a farm have to be to produce a certain volume of palm weevil?


####**Container rearing**

_**The following information is based on the field research in Thailand from M. Hoddle (University California Riverside) described in the article Entomophagy: Farming Palm Weevils for Food. The article can be found here: http://cisr.ucr.edu/blog/.**_

After approximately four weeks (harvest may begin as early as 17-20 days post inoculation with adults) larvae are ready to be harvested and each ~30 liter container can yield up to 2 kg of larvae (1 kg = approximately 150 large weevil larvae)

At the weevil farm in Songkhla Province, containers of palm weevil larvae were stacked on shelves in a cinder block storage shed (the shed lacked temperature, humidity, and light control). The storage space, approximately 30 m2, held 130 bins stacked vertically in columns of 2-3 containers on shelves. A rough estimate based on the data above suggests that if each bin produced 2 kg of larvae at 250BHT/kg, this would yield 260 kg/mo and 65,000BHT (or about $2,000US assuming all larvae are sold), which equates to a return of about $24US/m2 of rearing space. 

The production statistics could not be verified during this field trip, but the price per kg of larvae cited by weevil farmers was consistent at around 250BHT/kg. Mass production of palm weevil would appear to very profitable, but realized returns may be lower than estimated here due to variable demand. A second farmer in Nakhom Si Thammarat Province, indicated that daily sales could very variable, ranging from 0-1 kg sold per day up to 10+ kg/day if religious festivals and holidays were being observed. Infrastructure costs to house rearing containers may actually be very low too.

#### **Palm tree rearing**

**_The following data is based on the FAO report Six-legged livestock: edible insect farming, collect on and 
marketing in Thailand_**

Production cost per kilogram of palm weevil larvae bred in sago palm trunks is about THB20/kilogram. One palm stem (length 50 centimetres) can produce 2-3 kilograms/trunk. The sale price is THB200-250/kilogram. Therefore net profit is around THB180-230/kilogram. Farmers on average use 350 to 400 palm trunks for weevil breeding. The 
net profit per harvesting cycle (35 to 45 days) can be around THB143 000-164 000. 



#### **General**

Palm trunks tent to have a higher profitability of production  because no extra feed costs are included with the trunks whereas in basin production feed inputs (pig feed) are required. 

In addition to producing food, palm weevil farming has several very useful by-products that can be sold. First, the mash used to rear weevils can be sold as compost to amend soils. Second, the spent mash if set up in special storage areas can be left to drain and this “water” can be collected and sold as fertilizer, similar to worm water fertilizer that is collected from worm composting facilities. Third, in the case of using palm logs for rearing, the hollowed out palm trunks can be cleaned up and sold as containers for growing plants.
