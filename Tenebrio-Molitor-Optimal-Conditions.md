### Pupae
From X to Y individuals per cm2
### Beetle
From X to Y individuals per cm2

## **Keeping the abiotic conditions**
### Temperature
* Minimum - Reported as low as 20º C, Martin et al. (1976) 
* Optimal - 25 to 27º C
* Maximum - 40º C - 35º+ reported as "unstable" and 40º resulting in imminent death, Martin et al. (1976) 

Meal worms might need heating during colder months of the year to keep the colony productive and to avoid deaths. Some farmers use electric heat mats under meal worms' bins to keep the temperature within the optimal range for the species.
A cheap heat mat alternative is white indoor/outdoor all weather Christmas lights. They can give 85º Farenheit (30ºC), come in 50 to 100 bulb bunches and use minimal electricity.
For more even heat put Christmas lights in 2 - 3 inches of sand below mealworm's bins. If can't get uniform clean sand or it is more convenient then use standard cat litter to place the light strands in.

### Humidity
* Minimum - 13%
* Optimal
* Maximum - 70%

Some studies reported that with humidity close to 70% meal worms grow bigger.
### Light
* Dark place (do not need sun exposition)
