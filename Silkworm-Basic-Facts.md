## **Life cycle**

The Silkworm (Bombyx mori) is the caterpillar of a moth whose cocoon is used to make silk.


* **Eggs**

A female silkworm moth usually lays about 500 yellow eggs (Johnson, 1982). The eggs have a glue-like covering that makes them stick to anything the touch. The eggs hatch at 25Â°C after about 10 days (Nayar, 1963).
Silkworms hatch by eataing a hole in the soft covering of their eggs.

* **Larvae**

When the eggs hatch the larvae are less than 3 millimetre long, with large black heads and bodies covered with hair. As silkworms are a domesticated species, they complete depend upon human care. Nayar writes in an article Practical Methods of Year-Round Laboratory Rearing of the Silkworm (1963) : _"One of the remarkable characteristics of the silk- worm is its complete dependence upon human care, demonstrating the complete domesticity of the species. Thus, larvae placed in a small tray or crystallizing dish will not normally wander to seek food, and if left unattended will die of starvation. However, newly hatched larvae do have a tendency to move about"._ Silkworms have been changed so much by domestication that even if they were turned loose in a grove of mulberry trees, they probably could not feed themselves. (Johnson, 1982)

For that reason it is important to provide clean, dry, airy, and constant temperature conditions (25n
 C). The food must be changed twice a day, the younger larvae being given chopped leaves and the older larvae enough whole leaves to last until the next feeding. On a silk farm, the newly hatched silkworms are put on feeding tables among heaps of chopped mulberry leaves (Johnson, 1982). Even with their weak legs, the silkworms can get a good meal here.

The silkworm passes through five larval stages. At the end of each stage a period of rest occurs which lasts about a day. During each rest the silkworm remains motionless with its head raised in the air. The skin, splits and they molt. The time between molts is about five days (Barufaldi, 1974). After the final molting-the fifth stage-the larvae are mature, about 8 cm long. Now they will enter a final eating stage which lasts about eight days. During this period they will consume many times their weight in food. 

After their last and fifth instar, silkworms stop eating and are ready to start their cocoons. It takes at least 2 days for a silkworm to finish making its cocoon (Johnson, 1982). 




* **Pupa**

Within the protection of its cocoon, a silkworm changes into a pupa. It sheds its skin for another time but underneath the skin is a soft yellowish body that has a whole different shape. This is the pupa. The body will now begin to go through the great changes that will transform it into an adult moth.

* **Adult**

After about three weeks inside its cocoon (Johnson, 1982) the pupa will have become an adult moth. The moth has to work hard to get out of the pupa shell as it, like other adult moths and butterflies, has no teeth to bite its way through the cocoon. The moth uses a special liquid that softens and dissolves the silk so that the moth can push its way through the cocoon. Silkworm moths mate immediately after emergence and begin to lay eggs almost at once. Females lay eggs on everything that has a rough surface (e.g. filter paper). The adult lives up to 25 days and requires no food or water (Barufaldi, 1974).
