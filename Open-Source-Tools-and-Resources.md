**Here is a list for open sources hardware, software and other resources available that may be useful to members of the Open Bug Farm community.**

### Public Lab - Open Source Science

Public Lab from their website ([www.publiclab.org](www.publiclab.org)) is:

>a community -- supported by a 501(c)3 non-profit -- which develops and applies open-source tools to 
>environmental exploration and investigation. By democratizing inexpensive and accessible Do-It-Yourself
>techniques, Public Lab creates a collaborative network of practitioners who actively re-imagine the human
>relationship with the environment.

And they have a few projects with potential for application to our efforts advancing insect farming practice:

### Public Lab Tools

Of particular interest:
[Spectrometer](http://publiclab.org/wiki/spectrometer) - identify chemicals

[Near Infrared Camera](http://publiclab.org/wiki/near-infrared-camera) - typically used to assess plant health, who knows what it might tell us about insects, or potentially spot mold/fungal growth, etc..

[Thermal Camera](http://publiclab.org/wiki/thermal-camera) - useful to optimize environmental management in a facility, individual habitats, possibly to track insect concentrations

[Water Quality Sensor](http://publiclab.org/wiki/water-quality-sensor) - especially in developing or off-the-grid contexts

### Smartphone microscope kit

This open project, available on Instructables here [http://www.instructables.com/id/10-Smartphone-to-digital-microscope-conversion/](http://www.instructables.com/id/10-Smartphone-to-digital-microscope-conversion/) has plans for an easy to build (~$10) platform that converts your smartphone into a microscope
(Tiny Farms team has built one of these and it's awesome!)

### APDuino

[http://apduino.org/](http://apduino.org/) - An open source platform built to manage controlled environment agriculture like hydroponics and acquaponics using inexpensive Arduino micro-controllers and sensors. The project provides a web-based platform to manage sensor-actuator logic so no real programming experience is necessary! This could be particularly useful for larger scale operations that require more active environmental management and have enough at stake to warrant real-time remote alerts when something's broken or out of balance.
