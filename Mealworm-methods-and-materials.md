## **Bins**
### Material			
Meal worms can be raised at wood or plastic bins. Each material has its advantages and disadvantages, but it is nearly consensual that the use of plastic bins is better given their durability, light weight and impermeability. Wood bins can also be more susceptible to the proliferation of fungi and bacteria.

### **Dimensions**
Meal worms are easily adapted being able to thrive in bins from almost every size.

### **Aeration**
It is important to allow air circulation to the meal worms' bins. Holes can be made on the sides and/or the top of the bins. Holes do not need to be wide, in fact they should be smaller than the larvae diameter.

A common practice is to cut or drill fairly large holes in the top or upper sides of the bin (~1"/2.5cm diameter) and then cover the hole with screening (such as standard steel or fiberglass window screen which can be purchased in rolls)

## **Bags**
The use of and soon some tests will be made and the results will be incorporated in this guide. For more information click [here](http://forum.openbugfarm.com/index.php?p=/discussion/46/ultra-cheap-mealworm-production).

The bags are tubes of fine mesh (no-see-um rated mosquito mesh) with a strip of nylon webbing (like that used by climbers and slackliners) sewn to one side of the opening, rolled a few times and then closed at the end into loops that prevent insect escape and provide for easy hanging. The closing method is similar to that used for waterproof bags used by kayakers and rafters, as shown in this illustration:

## **Substrate**
The most common items include carrot, corn (grain and flour), oat (bran and grain), peanut, potato, powered milk, rye (bran, flour and grain), sawdust, soy (flour and grain) and wheat (bran, grain and flour). 
Several combinations of ingredients are successful used to raise meal worms, and they can vary according to the availability and price.

### **Other items**
Some farmers opt to put egg cases or toilet paper rolls inside meal worms' habitats, given that they often seek for these items when in captivity. Notwithstanding, meal worm larvae often makes holes at the cardboard, which may contain traces of chemicals that ultimately could harm meal worms and their consumers.

Another practice recommended by some sources ( [http://tnfarchives.nofa.org/?q=article/how-culture-mealworms](http://tnfarchives.nofa.org/?q=article/how-culture-mealworms) and [http://www.sialis.org/raisingmealworms.htm](http://www.sialis.org/raisingmealworms.htm) ) is to lay a piece of burlap over the surface of the bedding to provide a continuous hiding place for the larvae. One must be careful to use untreated burlap - much burlap is treated with pesticides or other chemicals to protect it and it's contents from rot and, naturally, insects. Although this practice may work well on a small scale, it adds to the labor required for cleaning, sorting, harvesting in additional to adding to the material costs of the habitat.

# **Farming**

## **Starting the meal worm farm**
Mix the items of the substrate and put on the habitat (bin or bag).

Add the egg cases and/or toilet paper rolls.

Add the mealworms.
