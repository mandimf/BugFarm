## **Life cycle**

The life cycle of palm weevils is simple and all stages (egg, larva, pupae and adult) are spent inside the palm itself and the life cycle cannot be completed elsewhere. 


* **Eggs**

Female weevils lay eggs inside holes that they make in suitable areas (e.g., bases of palm fronds where they attach to the palm crown) with their long snout or rostrum. Weevil larvae hatch from eggs and burrow into the palm where they commence feeding.



* **Larvae**

Larvae pass through several developmental stages, the exact number seems to vary and may be related to food quality, and probably human uncertainty in accurately classifying larval life stages.

* **Pupae**

Once larval development is complete, pre-pupal larvae spin tightly woven cocoons from palm fibers within which they pupate. Cocoon spinning requires larvae to be wedged into a substrate upon which sufficient purchase can be attained to allow the larva to simultaneously rotate and spin palm fibers into a cylindrical, cigar shaped cocoon within which they will pupate.

* **Adult**

Upon completion of pupation, adult weevils emerge and they may breed within the palm host they occupy or they could disperse to new areas. When suitable host palms are nearby weevil flight appears to be limited in distance and attacks on neighboring palms are more likely to occur and attacks are thus aggregated in distribution. In the absence of near neighbors, weevils can fly significant distances, > 20 km in a 24 hr period, to find host palms.
