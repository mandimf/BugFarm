#### Temperature

Minimum:
 
Rahmathulla (2012) mentions that at 20°C all the physiological activities are retarded, especially in early instars; as a result, worms become too weak and susceptible to various diseases.

Optimal: Data based on reports from Rahmathulla (2012) and Rajan (1996)

Incubation|1. instar|2. instar|3. instar|4. instar|5. instar|Spinning|Cocon preservation|
----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|------------------|
25°C|28°C|27°C|26°C|25°C|24°C|25°C|25°C|

If silkworms are reared in such temperature it is absolutely necessary to feed them with rich nutritive leaves in sufficient quantity. If the leaf quality and quantity are insufficient, it is necessary to lower the temperature by one degree in each instar (Rajan, 1996)



Maximum: 

Above 30ºC will directly affect the health of the worms (Rahmathulla, 2012)

#### Humidity


The effect of rear:ing humidity upon the growth and health of silkworm is similar to that of rearing temperature. High humidity makes the length of the growing period of silkworms short, accelerating the physiological activities whereas low humidity makes the length of the growing period longer. Humidity influences the physiological functions of silkworms directly (Rajan, 1996)

Optimal humidity based upon reports from: Rahmathulla (2012), Gov. of India (n.d.) and Rajan (1996):

Incubation|1. instar|2. instar|3. instar|4. instar|5. instar|Spinning|Cocon preservation|
----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|------------------|
75%-80%|85%|85%|80%|75%|70%|70%|80%|
