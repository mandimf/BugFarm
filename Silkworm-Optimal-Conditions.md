#### Temperature

Minimum:
 
Rahmathulla (2012) mentions that at 20°C all the physiological activities are retarded, especially in early instars; as a result, worms become too weak and susceptible to various diseases.

Optimal: Data based on reports from Rahmathulla (2012) and Rajan (1996)

Incubation|1. instar|2. instar|3. instar|4. instar|5. instar|Spinning|Cocon preservation|
----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|------------------|
25°C|28°C|27°C|26°C|25°C|24°C|25°C|25°C|

If silkworms are reared in such temperature it is absolutely necessary to feed them with rich nutritive leaves in sufficient quantity. If the leaf quality and quantity are insufficient, it is necessary to lower the temperature by one degree in each instar (Rajan, 1996)



Maximum: 

Above 30ºC will directly affect the health of the worms (Rahmathulla, 2012)

#### Humidity


The effect of rear:ing humidity upon the growth and health of silkworm is similar to that of rearing temperature. High humidity makes the length of the growing period of silkworms short, accelerating the physiological activities whereas low humidity makes the length of the growing period longer. Humidity influences the physiological functions of silkworms directly (Rajan, 1996)

Optimal humidity based upon reports from: Rahmathulla (2012), Gov. of India (n.d.) and Rajan (1996):

Incubation|1. instar|2. instar|3. instar|4. instar|5. instar|Spinning|Cocon preservation|
----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|------------------|
75%-80%|85%|85%|80%|75%|70%|70%|80%|



#### Light

Silkworms are photosensitive and they have a tendency to crawl towards dim light. They do not like either strong light or complete darkness. Rearing of silkworms in continuous light delays the growth. Rajan et.al. reports that  silkworms require a minimum period of 16 hrs. light per day. ln case of silkworms reared in such conditions the weight of cocoons and cocoon shell become heavier than that of the larvae reared in dark condition.

Rahmathulla reports that Late-age worms survive better in 16-hour light and 8-hour dark periods. However, young-age worm prefers 16 hr darkness and 8 hr light period.
