### Rearing container

#### **Material**:

* **Container:**

Palm Weevils can be readily grown from eggs to adults in large round plastic containers that would normally be used as basins for holding water or animal feed.


* **Palm trunks:**

The tradional method is farming directly in palm trunks or stems. M. Hoddle reports: "_one weevil farming operation in Nakhom Si Thammarat Province used rounds of fan palm trunks (Corypha umbraculifera) approximately 0.33-0.5 m tall for rearing. This farmer preferred the flavor and texture of weevil larvae and pupae produced from fan palm trunks and weevil development is slower and palm trunk longevity is greater when compared to a similar set up with sago palm trunk sections._"



#### Dimensions: 

* **Container:**

M. Hoddle reports that palm weevil farmers in Thailand use containers of +- 30 liters. The FAO reports that farmers in Thailand use a round plastic container of approximately 45 centimetres in diameter and 15 centimetres high. M. Hoddle as wel as the FAO report that farmers with these containers, can yield up to 2KG of larvae after 4 weeks.

* **Palm trunk:**

Cabbage palm or sago palm trunks or stems are cut into 50 cm lengths, then ten holes are drilled 5 cm deep in the trunk (FAO, 2013).After 40 to 45 days palm weevil larvae can be harvested. The total yield is around 2 kg of fully grown palm weevil larvae per cabbage palm or sago palm trunk. The same palm trunk can be used to breed the palm weevil larvae for the second generation on and can be used for up to eight months.

Palm material, either mechanically shredded central portions of sago palm trunks (the outer bark is sliced off and used to cover the palm mash in basins or the shredded rachis of coconut palm fronds (the leaflets are sliced off with a machete and removed, as is much of the outer green epidermis covering the rachis).

Coarse chips of palm material and slices of palm trunk bark are soaked liberally in water in basins. After 3 days, water is drained, the mash is hand squeezed to remove excess water and approximately 500 g of pelleted pig food (made of rice husks, corn, soy bean, sunflower seeds, and peanuts) is added to the palm mash and stirred in.

### **Farming**

Based upon research of M. Hoddle:

* **Container rearing**

_**Left:** Red palm weevil rearing shed in Thailand, only 1/3 of this shed was used for rearing larvae. **Center:** Shelves with weevil larvae rearing containers in the mass production shed. **Right:** The harvest from the rearing containers, approximately 2 kg of weevil larvae_ (M. Hoddle, 2013)

A rearing shed is probably not needed as long as containers are protected from rain to stop them accumulating excessive water from rain events. A tarpaulin tied between trees may be sufficient to provide shelter from excessive rain and sun events and will still allow adequate air flow over containers. The mash in which larvae are grown is highly saturated and modest rain accumulation would likely be tolerable.

Adult weevils either collected from infested palms in the wild or reared previously are used to inoculate containers with palm mash. Three male-female pairs are introduced per container and removed after 15 days. 

Adults are then combined to make groups of 5 pairs and used to inoculate new containers. Adults may be discarded after two rounds of container inoculation. Once adults are added to containers, the mash is covered with the slices of water-soaked palm trunk bark that was removed prior to grinding the heart of the sago palm trunk. These bark slices provide protective cover for adult weevils so they don’t fly away and later they provide the substrate and long palm fibers needed for cocoon spinning by mature larvae.

_**Left:** Cut palm logs to be used for rearing palm weevils. **Right:** Palm logs inoculated with palm weevils in Thailand._(M. Hoddle, 2013)

Individual rounds were placed under crudely built shade structures and on top of each round fermenting palm mash was placed to a depth of about 2-3 cm. Adult palm weevils were placed on the mash and then covered with flaps of palm bark that was pushed firmly into the mash thereby providing a protected space for the adults live, feed, and lay eggs. No preparation of palm trunks other than the application of palm mash and bark pieces is needed for this rearing set up. After approximately 3 months the first crop of weevils is ready to be harvested, and each palm round can produce larvae for up to 6 months for a total production of about 3 kg of larvae.
