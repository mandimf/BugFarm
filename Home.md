## Welcome to the Open Bug Farm Wiki!



### What is Open Bug Farm wiki?


This is an online database with information on everything related to farm insects for food and feed. The information is made available by the Open Bug Farm community: individuals around the world who are sharing knowledge about how to raise edible insects.

This datebase is part of Open Bug Farm: an Open Source project to design equipment and techniques for use in farming insects for food and feed.
