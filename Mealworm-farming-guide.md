The life cycle of meal worms can be divided into 4 stages, namely the egg, larva, pupa and beetle. The complete life cycle of meal worms varies from 19 to 31 weeks.

* Eggs hatch into larva.
* Larvae burrow below the surface of the grain and undergo a series of molts (10 to 20, average of 15), shedding their exoskeleton.
* The last molt occurs about three months after the egg stage. Newly molted worms are white, and the exoskeleton has not hardened so they may be more digestible.
* The fully grown larvae (worms) are golden brown and 0.98 to 1.38 inches (2.50 to 5 cm) long, with about 200 worms weight about an ounce (28.35 g).
* The larvae come to the surface. They turn soft and plump, stop moving, curl into a "C" shape, and then transform into naked white pupae that turn yellowish brown after a day.
* The pupae do not eat or move much.
* Adult darkling beetle develops after 6 to 24 days (or more) from the pupae. At first, the beetle is white/light beige with a soft shell, and then it darkens and hardens to red, brown, and finally turns dark brown/black after about 2 to 7 days. The beetle is about a half to three quarters of an inch (1.25 to 1.90 cm) long. Males and females are visually indistinguishable.
* Beetles lay their eggs 9 to 20 days after emergence. They lay for 2 or 3 months, and then die. Each female beetle lays about 275 tiny, bean-shaped white eggs - about 40 per day. The eggs are seldom seen because they are sticky and rapidly become coated in substrate.
* Egg incubation takes 4 to 19 days (average of 12).
* The cycle begins again as the eggs hatch into larvae, which may not be easy to see for several weeks. In 4 to 6 weeks they will be about 0.5 inches (1.25 cm) long.

### **Fecundity**
Each female beetle can lay up to 500 eggs.


# **Material and methods**

## **Bins**
### Material			
Meal worms can be raised at wood or plastic bins. Each material has its advantages and disadvantages, but it is nearly consensual that the use of plastic bins is better given their durability, light weight and impermeability. Wood bins can also be more susceptible to the proliferation of fungi and bacteria.

### **Dimensions**
Meal worms are easily adapted being able to thrive in bins from almost every size.

### **Aeration**
It is important to allow air circulation to the meal worms' bins. Holes can be made on the sides and/or the top of the bins. Holes do not need to be wide, in fact they should be smaller than the larvae diameter.

## **Bags**
The use of and soon some tests will be made and the results will be incorporated in this guide. For more information click [here](http://forum.openbugfarm.com/index.php?p=/discussion/46/ultra-cheap-mealworm-production).

## **Substrate**
The most common items include carrot, corn (grain and flour), oat (bran and grain), peanut, potato, powered milk, rye (bran, flour and grain), sawdust, soy (flour and grain) and wheat (bran, grain and flour). 
Several combinations of ingredients are successful used to raise meal worms, and they can vary according to the availability and price.

### **Other items**
Some farmers opt to put egg cases or toilet paper rolls inside meal worms' habitats, given that they often seek for these items when in captivity. Notwithstanding, meal worm larvae often makes holes at the cardboard, 
which may contain traces of chemicals that ultimately could harm meal worms and their consumers.
 
### **Depth**
* From X to Y cm	

# **Farming**

## **Starting the meal worm farm**
Mix the items of the substrate and put on the habitat (bin or bag).

Add the egg cases and/or toilet paper rolls.

Add the mealworms.

## Mealworm Production Estimates
How big does a farm have to be to produce a certain volume of mealworms?
