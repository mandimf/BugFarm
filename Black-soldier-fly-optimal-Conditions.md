#### Temperature

Minimum: 0°C for no more than 4 hours (UNC, 2013)

Optimal: 25°C to 30°C. For mating, optimal temp. is 27.8°C (UNC, 2013)

Maximum: 45°C (UNC, 2013)

#### Humidity

Black soldier fly larvae develop most rapidly at 70 percent humidity. The rate of weight loss for the BSFL increases with decreasing humidity. The optimal humidity for black soldier fly mating is around 30 to 90 percent. It is very important to monitor humidity for captive rearing and breeding. We found that it is especially important to keep the grubs’ feeding medium at a proper moisture level — not so dry that it cements the grubs into the feed, and not so wet that they cannot breathe through the pores in their exoskeleton. (UNC, 2013)

#### Light

SFL do not survive well in direct light or in extreme dry or wet conditions. They prefer to be 8
- 9 inches deep in their food source. If they are too far below the surface, they will perform little bioconversion. Female flies avoid any sites that are anaerobic when trying to lay eggs. (UNC, 2013)
