These are illustrated instructions for sewing your own Mealworm Grow bag with the materials provided when you order an Unsewn Mealworm Grow Bag:

Cut and marked mesh - 1x

31.5" (80 cm) strip twill tape - 2x

5" (13 cm) strip twill tape - 4x

## Step 1:

Finish the edges of the sides of the "access sleeves". These are the 10" tall panels sticking out on either side of the main body of the bag. Laying the fabric flat, fold over the ends of each side on the line 1/2" from the end and sew the length of the fold over. Fold both ends toward each other, that is on the same side of the fabric. This is determining what will be the outside of the bag. Later we will fold the fabric in half and close it up with this access sleeve as the top of the bag.

##Step 2:

Sew the triangular "darts". to do this, fold the marked triangle so the two edges of the triangle meet, forming a flap sticking up from the rest of the fabric. The line will be the seam you sew, and the flap should be on the **outside** side of the fabric. This is the same side you folded over the ends of the access sleeve in step 1. Start sewing the seam from the edge of the fabric toward the point:

When you reach the point, sew just past the end of the folded over fabric, and then reverse to bring the seam onto the flap and knot it on the flap. Sewing off the end of the fabric ensures no mealworms can crawl into the dart flap from the bag, and knotting on the flap behind the main seam ensures there are no small holes formed in the main walls of the bag by knotting the end of the seam:

##Step 3:

Next you'll sew the two strips of twill tape to the **outside** of the bag along the two lines drawn on the fabric the length of the bag, between the darts and the sides of the access sleeve. 

The end of the twill tape should extend about 5" past the end of the fabric:

Line up the tape along the line so that the line is close to the edge of the tape, and most of the tape's width is on the side of the line closer to the access sleeve. Then sew down the length of the line, stopping at the crossing line at the other end of the fabric (1/2" in from the edge):

When you reach the end, turn the piece, cut the seam across the tape and then sew another seam back along the other side of the tape:

Repeat on the other side with the other strip of twill tape. Your bag will now look like this if folded in half:

##Step 4:

Now you'll close the top of the bag. Fold the bag in half so the strips of twill tape and dart flaps are on the outside, and the two sides of the access sleeve match up. You will make an L shaped seam here, closing the top of the bag to the edge of the access sleeve, and then up the side of the access sleeve. As you approach the corner, carefully rotate the fabric while sewing to create a curved corner seam (see second image below):

Repeat on the other side to finish closing the top of the bag and connecting the sides of the access sleeve.

##Step 5:

Next you'll close the ends of the bag. Fold the loose ends of the twill tape so they overlap along the top length of the end of the bag and pin the end shut, folding the dart flaps flat against the bottom of the bag, toward the edges. It may be easier to first pin the overlapping ends of the tap to the top side, and then pin that to the bottom:

Sew across the end, closing the mesh to the twill tape, make sure to run the seam off the end of the mesh onto the very edge of the tape. Then rotate the piece and double back, sewing another seam down the length of the end of the bag:

##Step 6:

Finally, sew the short strips to the corners to create the loops from which to hang the bag. First pin the strips to the corners like this:

Then sew a box at each end of the strip:

When all four corner loops are attached, your bag is ready for action!
