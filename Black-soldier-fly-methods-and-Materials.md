Medium - to small - scale operations include free - range animal husbandry, farms that have a mix of animals, or residential homes that have pet waste and/or compost. For a medium - to small - scale operation, a modular approach will be more effective, allowing for the BSFL operation to be easily scalable. Each modular unit is referred to as a grub tub.

1 Materials for a single grub tub will include a plastic tote bin (>20 gallon, depends on the
quantity of waste available), 2”x10’ PVC pipe, 2x 90 - degree PVC elbow joints, and a 5 - gallon collection bucket.

2 Cost of each grub tub is about $60. An alternative is to purchase a pre-made system called the BioPod which retails for around $200.

To build a grub tub, cut two equal sections of PVC pipe so that the
grubs can travel from the center of the tub, out the side of the tub (through a hole cut in the plastic), and
into a collection bucket. The PVC pipe should protrude approximately six inches from the tub. From the protruding end, place the elbow joint and a small section of PVC to reach the lip of the collection bucket. Cut the bottom 6 inches of the PVC in half along the length of the pipe to create a larger opening for the larvae to enter. The goal is to have the migrating BSFL drop in the 5-gallon collection bucket, from which they cannot escape.  The grub tub must be filled with a food source manually. When filling, be sure that the opened end of the PVC lies above the level of the manure so that BSFL have easy access to the point of exit.
