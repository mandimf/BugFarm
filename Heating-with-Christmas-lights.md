## Intro
Community member [@gringojay](http://forum.openbugfarm.com/index.php?p=/profile/68/gringojay) suggests Christmas lights as a safe and affordable source of heating.

## Description

A standard plant propagation tray heat mat puts out 20 watts. It's possible to get close to that ratio of watts per square area using Christmas lights.

There are different wattage incandescent Christmas lights, but all incandescents only "lose" 2% of wattage consumed as light & shed 98% as heat. LEDs, although cooler, will also put out heat if no ventilation/fan to dissipate their heat.

There is no problem to shallow bury indoor/outdoor Christmas lights for extended period of time in sand or cat litter. If using cat litter, avoid the clumping type (as well as any with diatomaceous earth that could contaminate the herd). The tactic is to compensate for them operating in a steady state within the space they are put.

Thus I use a scant 2 inches of burial, which mostly serves to stabilize the lights where you want them & makes a layout easy to modify. You can also tack down the lights to a structural feature that goes below &/or above &/or around the area - this would be the best design for the pre-made kits.

You may need to periodically intervene to prevent excessive heat build up & this can be manual shut off or ventilating at set times for less cost/low tech projects. More practical (yet an additional outlay) is to put a multiple setting timer in line (lights plug into timer & timer plugs into electric source) to periodically switch off the lights . There are AC current tab dial timers for about US$ 6 or digital timers for about US$25; both can turn off & back on multiple times in 24 hours.

Also rope lights, both incandescent & LED can come close to matching that heat mat ratio/area all coiled around underneath. For example Walmart brand LED 120 volt Christmas rope light put out about 3 watts per foot using 1/4W bulb per inch. Some others sell rope lights work out to 6 watts per foot.

Furthermore, these type of products can be found that run on various voltages. The 12 volt rope lights would solve off grid operations since a DC charged car battery (or two 6 volt deep cycle batteries) can run them.
