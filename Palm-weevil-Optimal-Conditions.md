#### Farming density

There appear to be no reported epizootics killing high densities of weevil larvae living inside palm trees (it is possible these have been overlooked because they occur inside palms and would be very difficult to observe, but lots of dead larvae and pupae would be obvious if detected and considerable work on several palm weevil species has been conducted in the field) (Hoddle, 2013).

-

Optimal:  25 ± 2ºC is the temperature Kaakeh et.(n.d.) reported using to rear palm weevils in the laboratory. 

Maximum:

#### Light

12:12 L:D is the photoperiod Kaakeh et.(n.d.) reported using to rear palm weevils in the laboratory.
